# automate-services-runner

Automate Services Runner is a PowerShell script designed to streamline the management of Django microservices in a microservice architecture. Instead of running each service individually, this script automates the process of starting or stopping all services at once, making development and testing more efficient.

# Features
Start all Django microservices simultaneously.
Stop all running services cleanly.
Logs the status of each service for easy monitoring.


# Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script:
    cd <YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT_PATH>\<FOLDER_NAME>
3.Update the script with the root path and folder name in place of <YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT_PATH> and <FOLDER_NAME>.
4.Ensure all microservice directories and the shared venv directory are correctly configured within the script.

# Usage

1. Start Services
    .\start_services.ps1 start
2. Stop Services
   .\start_services.ps1 stop
